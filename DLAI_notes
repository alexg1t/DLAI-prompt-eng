Large Language models (LLM)is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters.
There are two types:

->BASE LLM
Predicts next word based in text training data
Appears to fill text based on knowledge

->INSTRUCTION BASED LLM
Tries to follow instructions
Does what its asked to do
ALSO built from a base LLM and trained with inputs/outputs
Use with RLHF: Reinforcement learning with Human Feedback to make it better able to follow instructions

For most practical applications, its better to use Instruction Based LLMs, they are easier to undestand.

Following classes will explain how to be clear and specific
Prompts should be that way so the LLM does a certain work
